## Introduction

3D reconstruction from images is the process of capturing the shape and appearance of real objects from a collection of 2D images. This technology has applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, cultural heritage preservation, and more.

[TODO: image displaying 3D reconstruction pipeline overview - from multiple 2D images to 3D point cloud]

### The Challenge

Given multiple photographs of a scene taken from different viewpoints, we aim to:
1. **Recover 3D structure**: Determine the 3D coordinates of points in the scene
2. **Estimate camera poses**: Find where each photo was taken from (position and orientation)
3. **Create a coherent model**: Combine all information into a unified 3D representation

## Fundamental Concepts

### 1. Camera Model

A camera projects 3D world points onto a 2D image plane. This projection is mathematically described by the **pinhole camera model**:

```
x = K[R|t]X
```

Where:
- `X` = [X, Y, Z, 1]ᵀ is a 3D point in homogeneous coordinates
- `x` = [u, v, 1]ᵀ is the 2D projection in image coordinates
- `K` is the camera intrinsic matrix (focal length, principal point)
- `[R|t]` is the camera extrinsic matrix (rotation R and translation t)

[TODO: image displaying pinhole camera model with 3D point projection]

### 2. Epipolar Geometry

When the same 3D point is viewed from two cameras, the relationship between the two image points is constrained by **epipolar geometry**:

```
x₂ᵀ F x₁ = 0
```

Where:
- `F` is the **fundamental matrix** (for uncalibrated cameras)
- `x₁` and `x₂` are corresponding points in the two images

This constraint means that for any point in one image, its corresponding point in the other image must lie on a specific line called the **epipolar line**.

[TODO: image displaying epipolar geometry - two cameras, epipolar lines, and corresponding points]

### 3. Triangulation

Once we have corresponding points and camera poses, we can compute the 3D position of a point through **triangulation**:

```
Given: x₁ = P₁X and x₂ = P₂X
Find: X (the 3D point)
```

This is solved using least squares optimization, minimizing reprojection error.

## Feature Detection and Matching

### Traditional Methods

#### 1. Feature Detection
Classical methods detect distinctive points (corners, blobs) in images:
- **SIFT** (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform): Detects keypoints invariant to scale and rotation
- **SURF** (Speeded-Up Robust Features): Faster approximation of SIFT
- **ORB** (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF): Fast binary descriptor

#### 2. Feature Description
Each detected keypoint is described by a feature vector that captures local image appearance:
```python
# Example: SIFT descriptor
# - 128-dimensional vector
# - Histogram of gradients in 16 spatial bins
# - Invariant to illumination and viewpoint changes
```

#### 3. Feature Matching
Find correspondences between features in different images:
```python
# Brute-force matching with ratio test
matches = []
for desc1 in descriptors_img1:
    # Find two nearest neighbors
    dist1, dist2 = find_nearest_neighbors(desc1, descriptors_img2)
    # Lowe's ratio test
    if dist1 / dist2 < 0.7:
        matches.append(match)
```

### Modern Deep Learning Methods

## Deep Learning Methods

### LoFTR (Local Feature TRansformer)

LoFTR revolutionizes feature matching by using transformers for dense pixel-wise matching without explicit feature detection.

#### Architecture Overview

```
Input Images → CNN Backbone → Transformer Encoder/Decoder → Dense Matches
```

[TODO: image displaying LoFTR architecture - showing coarse-to-fine matching process]

#### Key Innovations:

1. **Detector-Free Matching**: Unlike traditional methods, LoFTR doesn't detect keypoints first
2. **Transformer Attention**: Uses self and cross-attention to establish correspondences
3. **Coarse-to-Fine Strategy**:
   ```
   Stage 1: Coarse matching at 1/8 resolution
   Stage 2: Fine refinement at full resolution
   ```

#### Mathematical Foundation:

The transformer computes attention between image features:
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√d)V
```

Where Q (queries), K (keys), and V (values) are projections of image features.

### SuperGlue

SuperGlue is a graph neural network that matches sparse features by reasoning about their spatial relationships.

#### Architecture:

```
SuperPoint Features → Graph Neural Network → Optimal Transport → Matches
```

[TODO: image displaying SuperGlue architecture - showing graph construction and message passing]

#### Key Components:

1. **Graph Construction**: Each keypoint becomes a node, with edges to spatially nearby points
2. **Message Passing**: Features are refined through attention-based message passing:
   ```python
   # Simplified message passing
   for layer in range(num_layers):
       # Self-attention within each image
       features_1 = self_attention(features_1)
       features_2 = self_attention(features_2)
       # Cross-attention between images
       features_1, features_2 = cross_attention(features_1, features_2)
   ```

3. **Optimal Transport**: Uses the Sinkhorn algorithm to find globally optimal matches:
   ```
   # Sinkhorn iterations for differentiable matching
   for _ in range(num_iterations):
       scores = normalize_rows(scores)
       scores = normalize_columns(scores)
   ```

### Comparison: LoFTR vs SuperGlue

| Aspect | LoFTR | SuperGlue |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Matching Type | Dense (all pixels) | Sparse (keypoints only) |
| Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Accuracy | Better in textureless regions | Better with good features |
| Memory | Higher | Lower |

## Structure from Motion (SfM)

SfM reconstructs 3D structure from a sequence of 2D images. COLMAP implements state-of-the-art SfM pipeline.

### Pipeline Steps:

1. **Feature Extraction & Matching** (covered above)

2. **Geometric Verification**
   - Estimate fundamental matrix using RANSAC
   - Remove outlier matches
   ```python
   # RANSAC for fundamental matrix
   best_F, inliers = None, []
   for iteration in range(max_iterations):
       # Sample 8 points (minimum for F)
       sample = random.sample(matches, 8)
       F = compute_fundamental_matrix(sample)
       # Count inliers
       current_inliers = [m for m in matches if geometric_error(m, F) < threshold]
       if len(current_inliers) > len(inliers):
           best_F, inliers = F, current_inliers
   ```

3. **Incremental Reconstruction**
   ```
   1. Initialize with two views
   2. While more images available:
      a. Find next best image (most matches to existing model)
      b. Estimate camera pose (PnP problem)
      c. Triangulate new 3D points
      d. Bundle adjustment (optimize all parameters)
   ```

[TODO: image displaying incremental SfM pipeline - showing step-by-step reconstruction]

4. **Bundle Adjustment**
   Jointly optimize all camera poses and 3D points by minimizing reprojection error:
   ```
   min Σᵢⱼ ||xᵢⱼ - π(Pᵢ, Xⱼ)||²
   ```
   Where:
   - `xᵢⱼ` is the observed 2D point
   - `π(Pᵢ, Xⱼ)` is the projection of 3D point Xⱼ by camera Pᵢ

## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Homogeneous Coordinates

We use homogeneous coordinates to handle projective transformations elegantly:
- 2D point: (x, y) → [x, y, 1]ᵀ
- 3D point: (X, Y, Z) → [X, Y, Z, 1]ᵀ

This allows us to represent projection as matrix multiplication.

### 2. Essential and Fundamental Matrices

**Essential Matrix (E)**: Encodes the relative pose between calibrated cameras
```
E = [t]ₓR
```
Where [t]ₓ is the skew-symmetric matrix of translation.

**Fundamental Matrix (F)**: For uncalibrated cameras
```
F = K₂⁻ᵀ E K₁⁻¹
```

### 3. Perspective-n-Point (PnP) Problem

Given n 3D points and their 2D projections, estimate camera pose:
```
Input: {Xᵢ, xᵢ} for i = 1...n
Output: R, t such that xᵢ ≈ K[R|t]Xᵢ
```

Common solutions:
- P3P: Minimum 3 points (4 solutions)
- EPnP: Efficient O(n) solution
- DLT: Direct Linear Transform (minimum 6 points)

### 4. Robust Estimation (RANSAC)

Random Sample Consensus handles outliers in feature matches:

```python
def RANSAC(data, model_func, error_func, threshold, iterations):
    best_model = None
    best_inliers = []
    
    for _ in range(iterations):
        # 1. Random sample
        sample = random_sample(data, min_sample_size)
        
        # 2. Fit model
        model = model_func(sample)
        
        # 3. Count inliers
        inliers = [d for d in data if error_func(d, model) < threshold]
        
        # 4. Update best
        if len(inliers) > len(best_inliers):
            best_model = model
            best_inliers = inliers
    
    # 5. Refine with all inliers
    return model_func(best_inliers)
```

## Implementation Pipeline

### Our Hybrid Approach

We combine multiple methods for robustness:

```python
# 1. Image Pair Selection
pairs = select_image_pairs(images, similarity_threshold=0.6)

# 2. Feature Matching (Hybrid)
if num_pairs > 400:
    # Large scenes: Use SuperGlue (faster)
    matches = superglue_matcher(image_pairs)
else:
    # Small scenes: Use LoFTR + SuperGlue (more accurate)
    matches_loftr = loftr_matcher(image_pairs)
    matches_superglue = superglue_matcher(image_pairs)
    matches = combine_matches(matches_loftr, matches_superglue)

# 3. COLMAP Reconstruction
reconstruction = colmap.incremental_mapping(matches)
```

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Multi-Scale Matching**: Match at different resolutions for better coverage
2. **Test-Time Augmentation**: Apply transformations (flip, rotate) for more matches
3. **Confidence Thresholding**: Filter low-confidence matches
4. **Adaptive Method Selection**: Choose method based on scene characteristics

[TODO: image displaying complete pipeline flowchart - from images to 3D model]

## Best Practices for Beginners

### 1. Data Collection
- **Overlap**: Ensure 60-80% overlap between consecutive images
- **Baseline**: Not too wide (lose correspondences) or narrow (poor triangulation)
- **Lighting**: Consistent lighting helps feature matching
- **Coverage**: Capture from multiple viewpoints for complete reconstruction

### 2. Parameter Tuning
```python
# Start with these defaults
config = {
    'image_resize': 1024,          # Balance speed vs accuracy
    'min_matches': 15,             # Minimum matches per image pair
    'confidence_threshold': 0.3,    # Match confidence threshold
    'ransac_threshold': 4.0,       # Pixels, for geometric verification
}
```

### 3. Debugging Tips
- Visualize matches to verify quality
- Check camera poses for unrealistic positions
- Monitor reprojection errors
- Verify sufficient baseline between views

### 4. Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Few matches | Textureless surfaces | Use LoFTR (dense matching) |
| Wrong poses | Outlier matches | Increase RANSAC threshold |
| Incomplete model | Insufficient views | Add more images |
| Drift | Accumulation errors | Loop closure, bundle adjustment |
