# Vision3D Pipeline Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Geometric Verification**
- **Problem**: Matches were stored in the database but not geometrically verified
- **Solution**: Use `pycolmap.match_exhaustive()` after importing features, exactly as done in the Kaggle notebook
- **File**: `vision3d/utils/colmap_interface.py:256-269`

### 2. **PyColmap API Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Code was using old pycolmap API methods that don't exist in v3.11.1
- **Fixed Methods**:
  - `camera.model_name` → `camera.model` (with ID to name mapping)
  - `image.rotmat()` → `image.cam_from_world.rotation.matrix()`
  - `image.tvec` → `image.cam_from_world.translation`
  - `point3D.image_ids` → `point3D.track.elements`
- **File**: `vision3d/core/reconstruction.py`

### 3. **Reconstruction Selection**
- **Problem**: Method signature mismatch when selecting best reconstruction
- **Solution**: Return both index and reconstruction object
- **File**: `vision3d/core/reconstruction.py:149`

## Results

Before fixes:
- Pipeline would hang or fail with 0 matches
- No 3D reconstruction produced

After fixes:
- Successfully processes images with LoFTR
- Geometric verification works correctly
- Produces 3D reconstruction with 7122 points from 2 test images

## Test Results

```
INFO:vision3d.core.pipeline:Reconstruction completed successfully!
INFO:vision3d.core.pipeline:Registered 2 / 2 images
INFO:vision3d.core.pipeline:Reconstructed 7122 3D points
```

The pipeline now matches the workflow from your successful Kaggle notebook implementation.
